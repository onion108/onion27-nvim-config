# My Neovim Configuration

My own neovim configuration. Don't guarantee this will work on your machine, but feel free to put it on your machine.
Requires at least `neovim 0.11`. Also requires `ripgrep`, `lazygit` and `fd` (a `find` replacement, not the file descriptor). And a bunch of language servers that even I can't remember.

You may want to change some absolute paths in the configuration. One I can remember is in the `coc-settings.json`.
